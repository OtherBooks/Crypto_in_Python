  <title>Block Ciphers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Most of the encryption today on the Internet is probably done with one of the cryptosystems called <em>block cipher
          <idx><h>block cipher</h></idx>
      s</em>, which do not provide as perfect cryptographic security as a one-time pad,
      but which have a much,
      much more modest level of difficulty in key management.
      Block ciphers are also very fast and have some nice security features that cryptosystems structured like the ones we've seen so far do no.

      Examples of block ciphers you may have encountered might include:
      <ul>

            <em>Advanced Encryption Standard [AES]<idx><h>Advanced Encryption Standard [AES]</h></idx>

              <idx><h>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</h></idx>

              <idx><h>NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology</h></idx>
            for use by the US federal government in unclassified situations;

            the <em>Data Encryption Standard [DES]<idx><h>Data Encryption Standard [DES]</h></idx>
            </em>,
              <idx><h>DES: Data Encryption Standard</h></idx>
            which was the NIST-authorized block cipher from 1977 to 2001; and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>invalidlabel</title>
          <p>
            <em>3DES</em>
              <idx><h>2@3DES, triple DES</h></idx>
            or <em>triple DES
              <idx><h>triple DES</h></idx>
            </em>, a block cipher pretty much consisting of doing DES three times,
            which was used for a while after it was known that DES was nearly broken but before AES was standardized.

      In this chapter,
      we will very briefly touch upon some of the most basic design principles for block cipher

      }} implementation to explore these principles,
      and use some code libraries to do real encryption with state-of-the art block ciphers.
