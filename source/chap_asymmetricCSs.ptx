  <title>Asymmetric [Public-Key] Cryptosystems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have seen that there are secure,
      fast, (relatively) easy-to-use cryptosystems,
      but which do require a special activity before the regular communication can start:
      secure, secret key sharing.
      There are various approaches to getting around the practical difficulty this may present in the real world
      (such as, noted above,
      getting your credit card number securely to an online vendor with whom you have not had the opportunity to perform the secret key-sharing ritual),
      including:

          There are protocols which allow two parties to create a shared secret by exchanging messages on a public network: Alice and Bob must merely exchange two messages and they will end up with a common secret value that Eve,
          even if she saw both of the messages,
          will not be able to compute.
          That shared value can then be used,
          directly or after further processing,
          as the key for a block cipher for more secure communication.
          The most famous of these protocols is Diffie-Hellman key exchange,

          about which more information can be found, <em>e.g.</em>, here:

        The details of Diffie-Hellman are based on some modest mathematics:
        it is quite accessible to an advanced undergraduate mathematics major.
        It's security rests on a hypothesis which is widely believed <mdash/> but not proven!
        <mdash/> by many mathematicians and computer scientists.

          Instead of basing a secure way for parties to build a shared secret by communications over a public channel on theoretical hypotheses,
          there is way to do the same thing using some specialized hardware and a deep understanding of quantum mechanics.

          and invented in the 1980s,
          this approach has been demonstrated first in the laboratory over ever longer distances since then,
          but is not yet in wide use in practice.
