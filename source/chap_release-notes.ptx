  <title>Release Notes</title>
  <p>
    This is a first draft of a free (as in speech, not as in beer,
    <xref ref="stallman2002free"/>)
    (although it is free as in beer as well)
    textbook for a one-semester, undergraduate cryptology course.
    It was used for CIS 491 at Colorado State University Pueblo in the spring semester of 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's not clear that any other instructor would feel comfortable using this version,
    without a lot of adaptation.
    In fact, I usually find that when I write an open textbook like this one,
    during the semester in which I am teaching the class,
    what results is a little rough and has a few real gaps.
    After another semester teaching with this book, the second version
    (which could well be twice as long!)
    will likely be much easier to use by others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless,
    in the spirit of openness, I'm sharing this first draft as well:
    if you want to use it for self-study or in a class you are teaching,
    feel free to do so <mdash/> just makes sure your seatbelt is fastened,
    as the ride might be a little bumpy at times. [That said,
    if you do use this and find typos, thinkos,
    or other issues, I would be grateful if you would tell me about them!]
  </p>
  <p>
    As I make improvements and additions to this work,
    you will always be able to find them on the page \burl{https://poritz.net/jonathan/share/owoc/}, so please look there for the best version.
