  <title>Conclusions; consider the blockchain</title>
  <p>
    At first the idea of an asymmetric cryptosystem
        <idx><h>asymmetric cryptosystem</h></idx>
    can seem a bit like magic.
    In fact, it must be admitted that the security of all of such cryptosystems in wide use today is based on assumptions that seem very reasonable but are not known with mathematical certainty:
    for example, the security of RSA
        <idx><h>cryptosystem</h><h>RSA</h></idx>
        <idx><h>RSA cryptosystem</h></idx>
    is based on the assumption that it is impossible to factor large numbers in a reasonable amount of time
    (for a certain precise meaning of the word
    <q>reasonable</q>).
  </p>
  <p>
    (Interestingly,
    the best known attack on this particular assumption, using a quantum computer,
        <idx><h>quantum computer</h></idx>
    seemed for a long time like science fiction,
    but now seems like it definitely will start to be deployed at least by entities such as nation-states which have sufficient resources.
    Leave it to science fiction to be the best weapon against magic!)

    How well all of the assumptions underlying asymmetric crypto
        <idx><h>asymmetric cryptosystem</h></idx>
    stand the test of time, and whether practical,
    quantum-resistant asymmetric cryptosystem
        <idx><h>asymmetric cryptosystem</h></idx>
    s can be designed and implemented is a question of enormous importance in the next decade(s) of history of the Internet.
    While that cliff-hanger is being resolved by hard-working technologists behind the scenes,
    there are other exotic applications of asymmetric crypto
        <idx><h>asymmetric cryptosystem</h></idx>
    which have been developed and which offer amazing potential benefits ... some which are, indeed,
    almost certainly too good to be true.
  </p>
  <p>
    One example of this is something that has come to be widely discussed recently,
    called a <term>blockchain</term>,
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>
    which you have probably heard of as the architecture underlying the cryptocurrency
        <idx><h>cryptocurrency</h></idx>
    <term>Bitcoin</term>.
        <idx><h>Bitcoin</h></idx>
    If you worked in education, you would also have heard of blockchain
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>
    s as, supposedly, the best place for high school diplomas,
    college transcripts, and professional certificates to be stored.
  </p>
  <p>
    A blockchain
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>
    starts with a data structure called a <term>hash chain</term>,
        <idx><h>hash chain</h></idx>
    which is basically just a sequence of data blocks that can keep growing
    (potentially forever),
    with one additional field in each block:
    the hash (under some cryptographic hash function
        <idx><h>hash function</h></idx>
    ) of the previous block.
    Note that since that previous block contained the hash of the block which preceded it,
    these hashes implicitly link all the blocks back to the very first block of the chain,
    which is often called <term>genesis block</term>.

    The security properties of cryptographic hash function
        <idx><h>hash function</h></idx>
    s given in <xref ref="def_hashfunction">Definition</xref> give hash chain
        <idx><h>hash chain</h></idx>
    s a remarkable property: they are <term>immutable</term>,
        <idx><h>immutable</h></idx>
    meaning they cannot be changed.
    Specifically, what that means is that if a whole bunch of people
    (call them
    <q>the hobbits</q>
    )
    are sharing copies of a hash chain, then someone else
    (call this person
    <q>Gollum</q>
    )
    cannot come to them and pretend that they have a valid copy of the chain which is the same at the beginning and the end,
    but has some extra blocks added in the middle.
    The reason this is impossible is that the first block <mdash/> say it's block number 141592 near the end where Gollum agrees with the hobbits would have the hash of two different
    <q>previous</q>
    blocks: the hobbits would just have the same block they all agree is number 141591,
    while Gollum would have that extra block he was trying to sneak into the chain ... and those two different pieces of data cannot have the same hash
    (or, at least,
    it is very hard to figure out what data should be in the block to make it have the same hash value).

  <question xml:id="az_hashchain">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Does all of this make sense?
        What was new or interesting, or what was old and uninteresting?
        Do you feel comfortable with the ideas of a hash chain,
        and with why it is immutable?
      </p>

  </question>
  <p>
    Several additional features make a hash chain
        <idx><h>hash chain</h></idx>
    into a blockchain.
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>
    These include the fact that parts of the data in the blocks must have valid digital signature
        <idx><h>digital signature</h></idx>
    s
        <idx><h>signature</h><h>digital</h></idx>
    <mdash/> a topic we have discussed in this chapter!
    <mdash/> and that the new blocks are the result of a
    <term>consensus protocol</term>.
        <idx><h>consensus protocol</h></idx>
    Such protocols enable everyone who gets a copy of the blockchain
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>
    to have confidence that they have the same chain of data blocks as everyone else who is using that blockchain.
        <idx><h>blockchain</h></idx>

  <p>
    Consensus protocols
        <idx><h>consensus protocol</h></idx>
    are a topic in even more advanced cryptology classes:
    don't stop here, there is much more that is fun, useful,
    and powerful to learn about in this field!
